      <p>Here is your yearly reminder that you are, again, one year older. Yay! Where were you last year and where are you now? Getting experiences in a new job, hustling through your busy life, getting that degree. Give yourself a little treat today, you have well deserved it. I love you a lot, and I wish you only the best for your day. Lots of mental and physical strength, love from people that matter to you and plenty of money. Enjoy your day. 
        <br> Love you 🖤</p>
